# Data-Analysis-Global-Shark-Attacks

After an initial look to the context and the data available, the valuable information I will extract will contain:
- The place(s) with more attacks
- The most common activity(ies) which led to the attack
- The gender most attacked
- The average age of the victim
- The rate of death

The final objective would be to find :
- Which gender, at what age, doing what in which part of the world has the highest risk of beeing attacked by a shark.
- Which gender, at what age, doing what in which part of the world has the highest risk of beeing attacked by a shark resulting in injury only.
- Which gender, at what age, doing what in which part of the world has the highest risk of beeing attacked by a shark resulting in death.


A first personal dubious assumption would be : 
- A man of 21y surfing in Australia resulting in injury but not death.
